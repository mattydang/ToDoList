# To-Do List
To-Do List App written with React.js library. App allows user to build their to do list by inserting chores, prioritizing chores by moving them up/down list, and removing tasks with tick button upon completion.

## Technologies Used:

### React.js

The project was mainly written in the ToDoList.jsx file, where HTML components and JS functions can be written in the same file.

React was used for the useState() hook, where functions could share variables that are updated in real-time. Arrow functions, setters, and callbacks were used to update functions and variables in real time.

### HTML

Created ordered list component to hold chores and buttons for chore movement.

### CSS

CSS styling was used to apply design to list, buttons, and general text and titles on application.
